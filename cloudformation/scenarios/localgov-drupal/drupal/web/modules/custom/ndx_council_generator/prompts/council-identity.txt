You are generating a unique fictional UK council identity for a demonstration website.
Generate a realistic but entirely fictional council that could exist in the UK.

Requirements:
1. Council name should follow UK naming conventions:
   - "[Place] District Council"
   - "[Place] Borough Council"
   - "[Place] County Council"
   - "[Place] City Council"

2. The place name should be:
   - Plausible sounding for the UK
   - NOT a real UK place name
   - 1-2 words maximum
   - IMPORTANT: Generate a COMPLETELY NEW name - do NOT use these banned names: Thornbridge, Millhaven, Ashworth, Kingsford, Brackenmoor, Westdale, Northfield, Riverside
   - Be creative! Combine elements like: stone/wood/ford/bridge/moor/dale/haven/worth/field/ton/bury/ham/leigh + Old English prefixes

3. Region must be one of: {{REGION_OPTIONS}}

4. Theme must be one of: {{THEME_OPTIONS}}

5. Population must be realistic for the council type:
   - small: 15,000 - 30,000
   - medium: 30,000 - 100,000
   - large: 100,000 - 300,000

6. Generate 5-8 local flavour keywords that match the theme and region. These will be used to generate contextual content later. Make them specific and evocative.

7. Generate a traditional council motto (brief, in English, formal but not pompous).
