- **Informed Decision Rate**: 72% (🟢 on target)
- **Analysis**: Solid performance driven by:
  - Addresses pain point familiar to planning teams (backlog reduction)
  - Strong "wow moment" showing 60% time savings
  - Effective use of before/after comparison in walkthrough

**3. Text-to-Speech**
- **Views**: 680
- **Informed Decision Rate**: 69% (🟢 slightly above mid-range)
- **Analysis**: Consistent performer:
  - Accessibility angle resonates with councils prioritizing inclusive services
  - Quick walkthrough (5 steps) maintains engagement
  - Clear cost transparency builds trust

### Underperforming Scenarios

**1. Smart Car Park**
- **Views**: 540
- **Informed Decision Rate**: 42% (🔴 37% below target)
- **Hypothesis**:
  - Complex technical requirements (IoT sensors, integration) may confuse non-technical users
  - Use case perceived as "nice to have" rather than urgent problem
  - Walkthrough may not clearly demonstrate ROI
- **Proposed Actions**:
  - Simplify walkthrough language, reduce technical jargon
  - Add cost calculator showing revenue generation potential
  - Highlight environmental benefits (reduced emissions from parking search)
  - Consider splitting into "beginner" and "advanced" paths

## Insights & Recommendations

### Key Insights

1. **Quiz is highly effective at matching users to scenarios**
   - **Observation**: Quiz completers have 12% higher informed decision rate (78%) vs non-quiz users (66%)
   - **Evidence**: 1,286 quiz completions, 68% completion rate, 78% subsequent scenario informed decision rate
   - **Implication**: Quiz should be promoted more prominently on homepage and scenario gallery

2. **Technical complexity correlates with poor scenario performance**
   - **Observation**: Scenarios requiring technical prerequisites (IoT sensors, data pipelines) underperform
   - **Evidence**: Smart Car Park (complex) 42% vs Council Chatbot (simple) 85% informed decision rate
   - **Implication**: Need "technical readiness" indicator on scenario cards, possibly split complex scenarios into phases

3. **G-Cloud CTR exceeds expectations when pathway is clear**
   - **Observation**: Scenarios with strong "proceed" pathways show 58% G-Cloud CTR
   - **Evidence**: 5 of 6 scenarios at or above 58%, only underperforming scenario (Smart Car Park) shows 24%
   - **Implication**: Next Steps page design is effective; focus should shift to improving scenario selection/engagement
