## What is NDX:Try?

NDX:Try is a free platform helping UK councils explore AWS cloud scenarios through hands-on evaluation. Deploy real AI and cloud solutions in 15 minutes, test with realistic council data, and generate committee-ready evidence packs.

Our mission is simple: **Let councils try before they buy**. As part of the NDX:Try programme, **AWS is providing all scenarios completely FREE** - zero cost to your council, zero commitment, and zero cloud expertise required.

## Part of the LGA AI Ecosystem

NDX:Try is part of the broader AI innovation landscape for local government, working alongside the [LGA AI Hub](https://www.local.gov.uk/our-support/cyber-digital-and-technology/artificial-intelligence) to help councils adopt AI responsibly.

The Local Government Association (LGA) AI Hub provides:

- **Policy guidance** on AI adoption in local government
- **Case studies** from councils implementing AI solutions
- **Research** on AI opportunities and risks
- **Networking** with peers exploring similar challenges

NDX:Try complements this by providing **practical, hands-on evaluation** of specific AWS scenarios councils can deploy and test themselves.

## How It Works

### 1. Discover

Take our [2-minute quiz](/quiz/) or [browse scenarios](/scenarios/) to find solutions matching your council's needs. Each scenario addresses a real local government challenge:

- Citizen engagement (chatbots, text-to-speech)
- Service efficiency (planning AI, FOI redaction)
- Data insights (smart car parks, QuickSight dashboards)

### 2. Deploy

Launch AWS scenarios with one click using pre-configured CloudFormation templates. No cloud expertise required - we handle the infrastructure setup automatically.

Your deployment runs in an **isolated Innovation Sandbox**, completely separate from your production systems.

### 3. Experience

Walk through guided demos with realistic UK council data. See exactly how the solution works, test edge cases, and understand operational implications.

Each scenario includes:

- Step-by-step walkthroughs (5-15 minutes)
- Screenshot galleries showing the user experience
- Video demonstrations (optional)
- Sample data reflecting real council use cases

### 4. Evaluate

Generate evidence packs for committee presentations. Download PDFs containing:

- Executive summary tailored to your persona (CTO, Service Manager, Finance Director)
- Technical architecture diagrams
- Cost projections and ROI analysis
- Security and compliance considerations
- Implementation timeline

### 5. Proceed

Connect with approved G-Cloud suppliers for implementation. Each scenario links directly to relevant G-Cloud services, with search terms pre-filled for your convenience.

## Who It's For

### CTOs and IT Leads

- Evaluate technical architecture and security posture
- Review infrastructure-as-code templates
- Test integration with existing systems
- Assess operational complexity

### Service Managers

- See citizen impact through realistic demos
- Understand operational benefits and workflows
- Identify process improvements
- Evaluate user experience

### Finance Directors

- Review detailed cost projections
- Compare deployment vs operational costs
- Assess ROI and payback periods
- Plan multi-year budgets

### Developers

- Explore technical implementation details
- Review CloudFormation templates
- Understand AWS service integrations
- Learn infrastructure-as-code patterns

## Platform Principles

Our design is guided by these core principles:

### 1. Grant Permission to Try

"You're not the first council to explore cloud AI, and you won't be the last."

We normalize exploration and reduce imposter syndrome. Councils shouldn't feel behind for investigating new technology.

### 2. Promise Safety

- **Isolated Innovation Sandbox**: Your evaluation is completely separate from production systems
- **Automatic cleanup**: Resources are deleted when you're done
- **Completely FREE**: AWS provides all scenarios at no cost as part of NDX:Try
- **No data leakage**: Sample data only, no connection to real citizen records

### 3. Respect Time

- **15 minutes to first insight**: Not 15 hours or 15 days
- **Skip deployment**: Watch videos and screenshots instead
- **Evidence packs**: Share with leadership without writing reports from scratch
- **Quick-start guides**: Get productive immediately

### 4. Enable Sharing

- All content is shareable with colleagues and leadership
- Evidence packs are presentation-ready
- Screenshots and videos can be embedded in business cases
- Open source code enables peer review

## Technology Stack

NDX:Try is built with:

- **Static site**: Eleventy (11ty) with GOV.UK Design System
- **Hosting**: AWS (S3 + CloudFront)
- **Templates**: AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure-as-code
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics 4 (privacy-first)
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.2 AA compliant

All code is open source under the MIT License: [View on GitHub](https://github.com/co-cddo/ndx-try-aws-scenarios)
