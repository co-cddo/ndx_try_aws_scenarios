<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What is the DEMO banner?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  At the top of every page, you'll notice a distinctive yellow and black striped banner:
</p>

<div class="ndx-demo-banner-example">
  <div class="ndx-demo-banner-preview">
    <span class="ndx-demo-banner-text">DEMONSTRATION SITE - [Council Name] is a fictional council</span>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This banner appears on <strong>every page</strong> of the site, including:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>The public homepage and all content pages</li>
  <li>The Drupal admin dashboard and editing screens</li>
  <li>Any custom pages or sections you create</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Why does it exist?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The DEMO banner serves several important purposes:
</p>

<div class="ndx-reasons-grid">
  <div class="ndx-reason-card">
    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Prevents confusion</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body-s">
      Visitors immediately understand this is a demonstration site,
      not a real council website. This prevents any confusion about
      the validity of information or services shown.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-reason-card">
    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Enables safe exploration</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body-s">
      Knowing the site is a demo, stakeholders feel comfortable
      clicking around, editing content, and experimenting without
      fear of breaking anything "real".
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-reason-card">
    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Supports screenshots</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body-s">
      If you share screenshots in reports or presentations,
      the banner clearly indicates this is a demonstration,
      maintaining transparency with stakeholders.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-reason-card">
    <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">GOV.UK compliance</h4>
    <p class="govuk-body-s">
      Using government design patterns without clear demo labelling
      could be misleading. The banner ensures compliance with
      transparency guidelines.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Why can't it be dismissed?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The DEMO banner is intentionally <strong>non-dismissable</strong>:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>There is no close button or "X" to remove it</li>
  <li>It cannot be turned off in Drupal settings (by regular users)</li>
  <li>It persists across all pages and sessions</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  This is by design. It ensures that anyone viewing the site - whether
  in a meeting, presentation, or casual browse - always knows they're
  looking at a demonstration.
</p>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>For production use:</strong> If your council decides to use
    LocalGov Drupal in production, the DEMO banner module would simply
    not be installed. It's only included in the NDX:Try demo environment.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">The council name</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The banner displays your demonstration council's name. This council
  is entirely fictional - no real council data is used.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Each deployment creates a unique fictional council with its own name, region,
  and local character using AI-powered council generation. Learn more in
