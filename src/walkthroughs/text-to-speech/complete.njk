    You've experienced AI-powered text-to-speech for accessible council announcements
  </div>
</div>

<p class="govuk-body-l govuk-!-margin-top-6">
  Congratulations! In just 8 minutes, you've seen how Amazon Polly generates broadcast-quality audio
  from text at 99.99% lower cost than studio recording while ensuring full accessibility compliance.
  What would have taken weeks to pilot with voice talent, you've experienced hands-on right now.
</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you've learned</h2>

<div class="ndx-takeaway-grid">
  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Natural-sounding neural voices
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You heard Amy's conversational warmth, Brian's authoritative clarity, and Emma's formal
      professionalism. These aren't robotic "computer voices" - Polly's neural engine generates
      speech with natural inflection, breathing patterns, and emotional tone appropriate for each
      announcement type.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: Residents won't know it's AI-generated - quality rivals professional studios
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Instant generation vs weeks of delay
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Text-to-speech converts announcements to audio in 30 seconds. No booking voice talent, no
      studio scheduling, no editing rounds. Paste text, select voice, click generate. If the
      announcement text changes, regenerate audio instantly for £0.008 instead of £100 re-recording fee.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: 99.98% faster (1-2 weeks to 30 seconds) with zero coordination overhead
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      99.99% cost reduction
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Studio recording costs £150-£300 per announcement (talent, studio time, editing). Polly costs
      £0.008 per typical announcement. For 50 announcements annually, savings of £10,000 - £15,000
      can be reallocated to frontline services.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: Pay-per-use pricing with zero upfront investment - low risk, high return
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Full accessibility compliance
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Text-to-speech ensures every announcement has an audio version, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA requirements
      under PSBAR 2018. Serves 2% of residents with visual impairments, 16% with literacy difficulties,
      and 19% aged 65+. Avoids penalties up to £20,000 per accessibility breach.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: Legal compliance + inclusive service delivery + reputational protection
    </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Committee-ready talking points</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Use these points when presenting to decision-makers:
</p>

<div class="ndx-committee-language">
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The problem</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "Currently, council announcements are published as text only on our website and printed notices.
    This excludes 2% of residents with visual impairments (1.3M UK residents), 16% with literacy
    below Level 1, and 19% aged 65+ who may have age-related vision decline. PSBAR 2018 requires
    accessible alternatives, but studio recording costs £150-£300 per announcement with 1-2 week
    turnaround. Due to cost and time constraints, we rarely produce audio versions, creating
    compliance risk under Equality Act 2010 with potential penalties up to £20,000 per breach."
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The solution</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "Amazon Polly text-to-speech generates broadcast-quality audio from announcement text in 30 seconds.
    UK English neural voices (Amy, Brian, Emma) sound natural and professional, not robotic. Cost is
    £0.016 per 1000 characters = £0.008 per typical announcement. Communications officers paste text,
    select voice, generate audio - 1 minute total. Audio file is saved to website and can be integrated
    with phone systems for automated announcements. No infrastructure required - pay only for audio
    generated."
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The value</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "For 50 announcements annually: Annual cost savings of £9,999.60 (from £10,000 studio recording
    to £0.40 Polly usage). Time savings of 99 hours per year (from 120 min coordination per announcement
    to 1 min). Compliance benefit: 100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance avoiding up to £20K penalties per breach.
    Accessibility benefit: Multi-channel delivery (web, phone, social media) ensures information reaches
    all residents regardless of ability. Reputational benefit: Demonstrates council commitment to
    digital inclusion and modern service delivery."
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The risk</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "Very low. Pay-per-use pricing means no upfront investment. £0.40 annual cost for 50 announcements
    is negligible (less than one coffee). Trial with 10 announcements costs £0.08 to validate voice
    quality and resident acceptance. Polly is a managed AWS service requiring zero infrastructure or
    maintenance. Integrates with existing CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla) via simple API. Typical
    pilot: 1-2 months with 10-20 announcements to gather resident feedback and refine voice selection."

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>50 announcements/year: ~£0.40/year (£0.008 per announcement)</li>

        <li>500 announcements/year: ~£4.00/year (includes service updates, newsletters, meeting summaries)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Budget safety: Set CloudWatch billing alarm at £50/month as absolute maximum. Actual usage

      <p class="govuk-body">
        ROI example: For 100 announcements/year, £0.80 cost vs £20,000 studio recording = £19,999.20

        <li>
          <strong>Pilot (Month 1-2):</strong> Generate audio for 10-20 announcements, embed on website,

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Integration (Month 3):</strong> Integrate Polly with council CMS, train communications
          team, create pronunciation lexicon. Apply to all new announcements going forward. Budget: £0.50
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backfill (Month 4):</strong> Generate audio for top 50 most-viewed historical announcements.
          Budget: £0.40
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Expand (Month 5-6):</strong> Extend to committee minutes, consultations, newsletters.
          Integrate with phone system IVR. Budget: £1.00

      </ol>
      <p class="govuk-body">
        Total pilot cost: £2.10 over 6 months. Expected annual savings once fully deployed: £10K-£30K
