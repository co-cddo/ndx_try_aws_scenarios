    You've experienced self-service analytics with Amazon QuickSight
  </div>
</div>

<p class="govuk-body-l govuk-!-margin-top-6">
  Congratulations! In just 10 minutes, you've seen how self-service analytics empowers officers to answer
  operational questions without IT dependency. What would have taken weeks to pilot, you've experienced
  hands-on right now.

{# Story 24.6: Sandbox vs Production clarification #}
<div class="govuk-inset-text govuk-!-margin-top-6" style="border-left-color: #1d70b8;">
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s" style="margin-top: 0;">Sandbox vs Production Architecture</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>This sandbox demo</strong> uses Chart.js with Lambda-generated sample data (£0.00/month) to demonstrate self-service analytics concepts without licensing costs.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Production deployment</strong> would use Amazon QuickSight with:
  </p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li><strong>QuickSight Reader users</strong> - £18/user/month for dashboard viewing, filtering, and export</li>
    <li><strong>QuickSight Author users</strong> - £24/user/month for creating/editing dashboards (1-2 per council)</li>
    <li><strong>SPICE in-memory caching</strong> - 10 GB free tier, enables sub-second queries over millions of rows</li>
    <li><strong>Athena serverless SQL</strong> - £5/TB scanned (typically £2-5/month for council data)</li>
    <li><strong>Glue Data Catalog</strong> - Auto-discovers CSV schema, free tier covers council usage</li>
    <li><strong>Embedded dashboards</strong> - Integrate into council intranet via iframe</li>
    <li><strong>ML Insights</strong> - Automatic anomaly detection and forecasting</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">
    Typical production cost: £200-400/month for 10-20 users with real-time analytics
  </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">What you've learned</h2>

<div class="ndx-takeaway-grid">
  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Real-time data exploration
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You filtered 5 months of service data by date range, service type, and ward with instant results. No
      waiting for IT to create Excel reports - answers in seconds, not days.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: 3-7 day lag eliminated → same-day decision-making
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      Interactive drill-down
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You clicked charts to drill into underlying data, sorted tables by any column, and explored multi-dimensional
      patterns. Officers can follow their curiosity without submitting IT tickets.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: Unlimited exploration vs static Excel reports
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      30-second committee reporting
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      You exported the dashboard to PDF in 30 seconds. This replaces 4.5 hours of analyst time creating
      PowerPoint slides from multiple Excel files. 90x faster committee paper preparation.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: 4.5 hours → 3 minutes per committee report
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="ndx-takeaway-card">
    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">
      80% IT dependency reduction
    </h3>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Self-service analytics reduces ad-hoc IT report requests by 80%, freeing 384 hours annually for strategic
      projects. IT shifts from repetitive reporting to digital transformation.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body-s" style="color: #505a5f; font-weight: 700;">
      Value: £13,440/year IT time savings + strategic focus
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Committee-ready talking points</h2>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Use these points when presenting to decision-makers:
</p>

<div class="ndx-committee-language">
  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The problem</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "Officers currently submit tickets to IT for ad-hoc reports, waiting 3-7 days for Excel spreadsheets.
    With 20 ad-hoc requests per month, IT spends 480 hours annually on repetitive reporting instead of
    strategic transformation projects. Data analysts spend 4 hours per week creating weekly service manager
    reports. This creates decision lag - service managers make decisions on week-old data, not real-time insights."
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The solution</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "Amazon QuickSight provides self-service business intelligence dashboards accessible 24/7 via web browser.
    Officers apply filters, drill down into data, and export reports without IT involvement. Dashboard reflects
    latest service metrics (updated daily or hourly via automated S3 uploads). 80% of routine questions answered
    through self-service, leaving IT to handle only complex analysis requiring custom queries."
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The value</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "For 10 users, annual savings of £17,340 (analyst time + IT time) against £2,218 cost delivers 6.8:1 ROI
    with 1.5 month payback. Beyond financial savings: faster decision-making (same-day data vs week-old reports),
    data-driven culture (officers ask more questions when answers are instant), democratic transparency
    (councillors access same dashboard as officers), and IT strategic focus (384 hours freed for automation
    and digital services)."
  </p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The risk</h3>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    "Low. Predictable £18/user/month pricing (Reader users). 2-month pilot with 5 users costs £450 to validate
    ROI and user adoption. Pre-built dashboards require no SQL skills - point-and-click filtering. CloudWatch
    billing alarms prevent unexpected costs. QuickSight connects to existing council data (CSV exports to S3)
    - no database migration required."
