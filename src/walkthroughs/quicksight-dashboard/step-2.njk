<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Understanding the KPI cards</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  At the top of the dashboard, you'll see 3 KPI (Key Performance Indicator) cards showing critical metrics:
</p>

<div class="ndx-kpi-explanation">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">KPI Card 1: Total Cases Received</h4>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Value:</strong> 267,334</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Meaning:</strong> Total number of service requests received across all service areas and regions</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Gives an overall picture of service demand. This represents real council workload that staff must handle.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-4">KPI Card 2: Average Resolution Rate</h4>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Value:</strong> 0.85 (85%)</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Meaning:</strong> 85% of cases received were successfully resolved</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Why this matters:</strong> High resolution rates mean residents receive effective service. 85% is a strong performance indicator.</p>

  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s govuk-!-margin-top-4">KPI Card 3: Average Satisfaction Score</h4>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Value:</strong> 4.15 out of 5</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Meaning:</strong> Average satisfaction rating from post-interaction surveys</p>
  <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Why this matters:</strong> Overall satisfaction indicator across all council services. 4.15/5 is "Good to Very Good" (industry benchmark: 3.5-4.0/5).</p>
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Reading the Cases by Service Area chart</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The horizontal bar chart shows case volumes for each of the 9 service areas:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-font-size-19">
  <li><strong>Environmental Health:</strong> Highest volume (~33K cases) - noise complaints, pest control, food hygiene</li>
  <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Second highest (~32K cases) - permits, fines, enforcement</li>
  <li><strong>Highways:</strong> (~31K cases) - potholes, street lighting, road repairs</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Services:</strong> (~30K cases) - general enquiries, signposting</li>
  <li><strong>Housing:</strong> (~30K cases) - repairs, tenancy, allocations</li>
  <li><strong>Waste Collection:</strong> (~29K cases) - missed bins, bulky waste, recycling</li>
  <li><strong>Planning Applications:</strong> (~29K cases) - applications, enforcement, appeals</li>
  <li><strong>Council Tax:</strong> (~28K cases) - billing, discounts, payments</li>
  <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> (~27K cases) - housing benefit, council tax support</li>
</ul>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Insight:</strong> Environmental Health and Parking generate the most cases. Service managers can use this
    pattern to allocate resources appropriately across service areas.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Reading the Satisfaction by Service Area chart</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The second horizontal bar chart compares satisfaction scores across service areas:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-font-size-19">
  <li><strong>Environmental Health:</strong> Highest satisfaction (~4.4/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Strong satisfaction (~4.3/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Customer Services:</strong> Good satisfaction (~4.2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Council Tax:</strong> Good satisfaction (~4.2/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Parking:</strong> Moderate satisfaction (~4.1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Waste Collection:</strong> Moderate satisfaction (~4.1/5)</li>
  <li><strong>Planning Applications:</strong> Lower satisfaction (~4.0/5)</li>
</ul>

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Insight:</strong> Environmental Health achieves highest satisfaction despite handling high volume.
    Planning Applications has lower satisfaction - possibly due to longer processing times or complex decisions.
    This suggests opportunities for improvement in the planning service.
  </p>
</div>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Exploring the Service Performance Breakdown table</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  The detailed table shows performance metrics broken down by service area AND region:
</p>

<table class="govuk-table">

<p class="govuk-body">
  The table includes data from 8 regions: East Midlands, London, North East, North West, South East, South West, West Midlands, and Yorkshire.

<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p class="govuk-body">
    <strong>Power of detailed tables:</strong> Officers can now see regional variations without requesting custom reports.
    Housing in London (4.38 satisfaction) outperforms Housing in North West (3.88) - why? This prompts useful questions.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m govuk-!-margin-top-6">Reflection: What questions can you answer?</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Just by looking at this dashboard for 3 minutes, you can now answer:
</p>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet govuk-!-font-size-19">
  <li>"How many total cases are we handling?" → 267,334 across all services</li>
  <li>"What's our overall resolution rate?" → 85% (0.85)</li>
  <li>"Which service area has the most demand?" → Environmental Health (~33K cases)</li>
  <li>"Which service has the highest satisfaction?" → Environmental Health (4.4/5)</li>
  <li>"How does Housing perform in London vs North West?" → London 4.38 vs North West 3.88</li>
</ul>

<p class="govuk-body">
  <strong>Without QuickSight:</strong> Each of these questions would require a separate ticket to IT, 3-7 day wait for Excel report.<br>
  <strong>With QuickSight:</strong> All answers visible in 3 minutes of dashboard exploration.
