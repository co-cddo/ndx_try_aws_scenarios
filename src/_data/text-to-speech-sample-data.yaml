troubleshooting:
  scenarios:
    - symptom: "Audio file not generating"
      possibleCauses:
        - "IAM permissions missing for Polly API"
        - "Invalid characters in input text (unsupported symbols)"
        - "Text exceeds 3000 character limit (API request)"
      solutions:
        - "Check CloudFormation outputs for Polly console URL with embedded credentials"
        - "Remove special characters like emojis, Unicode symbols"
        - "Split long announcements into multiple audio files or use SynthesizeSpeech streaming"

    - symptom: "Voice sounds robotic, not natural"
      possibleCauses:
        - "Using standard engine instead of neural engine"
        - "Selected wrong voice (non-UK English voice)"
        - "Low bitrate audio output setting"
      solutions:
        - "Ensure voice ID is 'Amy', 'Brian', or 'Emma' (neural UK English)"
        - "Verify engine parameter set to 'neural' not 'standard'"
        - "Select 24kHz sample rate for highest quality"

    - symptom: "Mispronounced words (place names, technical terms)"
      possibleCauses:
        - "Polly doesn't recognize specialized council terminology"
        - "Ambiguous pronunciation (e.g., 'Reading' as 'reed-ing' vs 'red-ing')"
        - "Abbreviations read as words instead of spelled out"
      solutions:
        - "Use SSML phoneme tags to specify pronunciation: <phoneme alphabet='ipa' ph='rɛdɪŋ'>Reading</phoneme>"
        - "Add pronunciation lexicon to Polly (upload custom pronunciation rules)"
        - "Spell out abbreviations where natural pronunciation preferred (NHS as 'N H S')"

    - symptom: "Audio playback not working in browser"
      possibleCauses:
        - "Browser codec support (older IE versions)"
        - "CORS policy blocking S3 audio file"
        - "Audio file URL expired (presigned URL timeout)"
      solutions:
        - "Use MP3 format (universally supported in modern browsers)"
        - "Configure S3 bucket CORS policy to allow audio playback from your domain"
        - "Use CloudFront for permanent public audio URLs (no expiry)"
        - "Check browser console for errors (F12 Developer Tools)"

    - symptom: "Audio cuts off mid-sentence"
      possibleCauses:
        - "Input text exceeds character limit for synchronous API"
        - "Lambda timeout before audio fully generated"
        - "Network interruption during download"
      solutions:
        - "Split text into chunks <3000 characters for SynthesizeSpeech API"
        - "Use StartSpeechSynthesisTask for long-form audio (asynchronous, no limit)"
        - "Check CloudWatch logs for Lambda timeout errors"

    - symptom: "High cost / unexpected charges"
      possibleCauses:
        - "Regenerating audio repeatedly during testing"
        - "Very long announcements (many characters)"
        - "Using neural voices instead of standard (4× cost, but worth it for quality)"
      solutions:
        - "Cache generated audio files - don't regenerate for same text"
        - "Monitor character count before generation (500 chars = £0.008)"
        - "Set up CloudWatch billing alarm for Polly usage"
        - "Neural voices cost more but quality justifies it for public-facing content"

  executiveSummary: "Amazon Polly text-to-speech enables instant conversion of council announcements to high-quality audio at 99.99% lower cost than studio recording. This delivers accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA, PSBAR 2018) while freeing communications staff from expensive, time-consuming audio production. For 50 announcements per year, annual savings of £10,000 plus £20,000 compliance risk reduction = £30,000 total value."

  problemStatement:
    title: "The Accessibility Challenge"
    points:
      - "Current state: Council announcements published as text only on website and printed notices"
      - "Visually impaired residents cannot access this information (2% of population = 1.3M UK residents)"
      - "PSBAR 2018 requires accessible alternatives - audio versions mandated for compliance"
      - "Studio recording costs £150-£300 per announcement, taking 1-2 weeks turnaround"
      - "Due to cost, we rarely produce audio versions = non-compliance risk"
      - "Potential penalty: Up to £20,000 per accessibility breach under Equality Act 2010"

  solution:
    title: "Text-to-Speech Automation"
    points:
      - "Amazon Polly generates broadcast-quality audio from text in 30 seconds"
      - "UK English neural voices (Amy, Brian, Emma) sound natural, not robotic"
      - "Cost: £0.016 per 1000 characters = £0.008 per typical announcement"
      - "Communications officer pastes text, selects voice, generates audio - 1 minute total"
      - "Audio file automatically saved to website, playable in all browsers"
      - "Optional: Integrate with phone system for automated announcements"

  benefits:
    financial:
      - "Annual cost savings: £9,999.60 (from £10,000 to £0.40 for 50 announcements)"
      - "Time savings: 99 hours per year freed from studio recording coordination"
      - "No upfront investment - pay per use only"

    compliance:
      - "100% WCAG 2.1 AA compliance - audio version for every announcement"
      - "PSBAR 2018 compliant - meet Public Sector accessibility regulations"
      - "Avoid penalties up to £20K per breach"
      - "Demonstrates due diligence to Equality and Human Rights Commission"

    operational:
      - "Instant turnaround - 30 seconds vs 1-2 weeks for studio recording"
      - "Easy text updates - regenerate audio in 30 seconds if announcement changes"
      - "Consistent voice quality - same neural voice every time"
      - "Multi-channel delivery - website, phone system, social media, podcasts"
